let num1 = 2

let multiply = num1 * num2 //is an equation whose multiplied results will equal 62

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1 //generates a random integer greater than 0

let mod = num3 % num4 //is an equation that calculates a remainder that is equal to 4

let max = Math.max(1,2,3,20) //will return 20 as the highest number in the set
